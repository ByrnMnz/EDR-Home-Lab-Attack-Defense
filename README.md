# EDR Home Lab: Attack Defense

## Project
This lab focuses on replicating a real-world cyberattack scenario with endpoint detection and response. Following Eric Capuano's online guide, I'll employ virtual machines to create both attacker and target environments. The attack machine will leverage the 'Sliver' C2 framework to infiltrate a Windows endpoint, which will be monitored by 'LimaCharlie' acting as the EDR solution.
